                    Global Electrician Dayâ„¢ was established in 2019 through a
                    collective effort of electricians, community leaders,
                    contractors, and local businesses who recognized the need to
                    honor the essential role electricians play in modern life.
                    On May 23, 2018, 66 community members and trades
                    professionals formally signed a declaration designating the
                    last Saturday in May as Global Electrician Day. The
                    declaration was officially recorded in the Broward County
                    Public Records under:

                    This initiative was endorsed by respected civic leaders,
                    including former Broward County Mayor Dale Holness.

                    At the time of its founding, no other dedicated "Electrician
                    Day" observance appeared prominently in online search
                    results or public records. This declaration was the first
                    known organized effort to establish a formal day recognizing
                    electricians globally.
